This is Crisp Cut, a simple game of reaction timing. The only goal int the game
is to chop the falling log on the line. If you do you get 3 points. If you go to soon
you get 1 point, and if you go over you lose.

The game is written in Java using the libgdx game framework. Most of the art was done by me,
with exception to the panels, buttons, and fonts, which are all by kenney.nl.

The game was mostly written while I was first learning to program, and I've added it to 
github in its messy state. I'm planning on cleaning it up a lot and adding documentation 
for some of the functions.
